# Scripts

Utility scripts for building, releasing, and maintaining the Notebook Navigator plugin.

## build.sh / build.ps1

The main build script that ensures code quality before deployment.

**Usage:**

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\build.ps1
```

**Features:**

- Generates icon constants from `icon.svg`
- Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues
- Runs Stylelint and regenerates `styles.css`
- Checks for unused localization keys and locale schema mismatches
- Validates TypeScript types
- Checks for unused imports and dead code
- Formats code with Prettier
- Runs unit tests
- Builds the plugin using esbuild
- **Aborts before bundling or deployment if ANY errors or warnings are found**
- Calls an optional local deployment script after a successful build (`build.sh` runs `build-local.sh`; `build.ps1` prefers `build-local.ps1` and falls back to `build-local.sh` when Bash is available)

**Requirements:**

- The build MUST complete with zero errors and zero warnings
- The build summary must show "✅ No warnings"
- Any lint, localization, type-check, test, or warning failure will abort the deployment
- Node.js `>=24.0.0` is required by `package.json`

## build-icons.mjs

Generates `src/constants/notebookNavigatorIcon.ts` from `icon.svg`.

**Usage:**

```bash
npm run build:icons
```

**Features:**

- Extracts the inner SVG content expected by Obsidian `addIcon()`
- Adds current-color stroke handling
- Writes the generated TypeScript icon constants file only when content changes

## build-styles.mjs

Generates `styles.css` from the source CSS entry point and section files.

**Usage:**

```bash
npm run build:styles
```

**Features:**

- Reads import order from `src/styles/index.css`
- Concatenates files from `src/styles/sections/*`
- Validates theming variables, defaults, grouping, ordering, Style Settings exclusions, and the complete example against
  `docs/theming-guide.md`
- Writes the generated `styles.css` file only when content changes
- Used by `npm run build`, `npm run lint:styles`, and `./scripts/build.sh`

## release.js

Automates the release process for the Obsidian plugin.

**Usage:**

```bash
node scripts/release.js                    # Publish an untagged merged version, or choose the next release
node scripts/release.js patch              # Prepare a patch release PR
node scripts/release.js minor              # Prepare a minor release PR
node scripts/release.js major              # Prepare a major release PR
node scripts/release.js patch --dry-run    # Preview release PR preparation
```

**Features:**

- Increments version numbers in `manifest.json`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `versions.json`
- Validates git repository state (clean, on main branch, synced with remote)
- Runs build verification before release
- Creates a release branch and pull request with the version bump
- With GitHub CLI, waits for release pull request checks, merges the pull request, then publishes by creating and pushing a git tag
- Pushes the tag to trigger the GitHub Actions release workflow
- Verifies the remote tag, GitHub release assets, release workflow result, and artifact attestations after publishing

**Version Types:**

- **PATCH** (x.x.X): Bug fixes, small tweaks, documentation updates
- **MINOR** (x.X.x): New features, backwards-compatible changes
- **MAJOR** (X.x.x): Breaking changes, major rewrites

**Important:**

- Never manually modify version numbers in files
- Always commit all changes before running
- Must be on main branch and synced with remote
- An authenticated GitHub CLI is required for release pull request automation
- If the script creates a pull request, leave it running while CI completes; it merges the pull request when checks pass and GitHub allows the merge
- If you stop the script after merging the release pull request, run `node scripts/release.js` again to publish

## package-m1-alpha.mjs

Creates a local, installable M1 artifact directory with SHA-256 checksums.

```bash
npm run build
npm run package:m1-alpha -- --output /tmp/picturefish-m1-alpha
```

The script copies only `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css`. It refuses a non-Picturefish manifest and never
overwrites a non-empty output directory.

## prepare-m1-test-vault.mjs

Creates a deterministic, secret-free Obsidian reference vault and installs an M1 artifact into it.

```bash
npm run prepare:m1-vault -- \
  --target /tmp/picturefish-m1-reference-vault \
  --assets /tmp/picturefish-m1-alpha \
  --notes 1600
```

The target must be empty, outside the source repository, and outside every production vault. The generated vault
contains nested folders, Unicode and long paths, repeated basenames, links, frontmatter, and synthetic attachments. See
[`docs/m1-validation.md`](../docs/m1-validation.md) for the acceptance matrix.

## gitdump.sh

Generates git diff snapshots for code review and backup purposes.

**Usage:**

```bash
./scripts/gitdump.sh
```

**Options:**

1. **Uncommitted changes** - Shows staged and unstaged changes
2. **Current branch vs main** - Shows all changes from main branch
3. **Current state vs before specific commit** - Shows changes since a specific commit

**Output:**

- Creates timestamped diff files in the parent directory
- File format: `{folder_name}_{type}_{timestamp}.txt`
- Useful for quick code reviews or sharing changes

## mdReleaseNotes.js

Converts release notes from TypeScript format to Markdown for GitHub releases.

**Usage:**

```bash
node scripts/mdReleaseNotes.js            # Print latest release notes
node scripts/mdReleaseNotes.js 3.2.2      # Print release notes for a specific version
```

**Features:**

- Reads release notes from `src/releaseNotes.ts`
- Defaults to the latest release notes entry
- Accepts a version argument, with or without a leading `v`
- Converts TypeScript object format to clean Markdown
- Outputs formatted release notes ready for GitHub release descriptions
- Automatically used by the release process

## build-local.sh / build-local.ps1 (Optional)

Custom local deployment script (ignored by git and not committed to the repository).

**Purpose:**

- Deploy built plugin to your local Obsidian vault
- Automatically called after a successful `build.sh` or `build.ps1` run if present
- `build-local.sh` is used by `build.sh` on macOS/Linux and as the `build.ps1` fallback when Bash is available
- `build-local.ps1` is preferred by `build.ps1` on Windows
- Already ignored by `.gitignore` to keep vault paths private

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Copy built files to Obsidian vault
cp main.js manifest.json styles.css ~/Documents/ObsidianVault/.obsidian/plugins/notebook-navigator/
```

## check-unused-strings.mjs

Finds unused i18n keys in `src/i18n/locales/en.ts` by scanning for `strings.<keyPath>` usage across `src` (excluding `src/i18n/locales`). Also validates that every locale file matches the English locale shape.

```bash
npm run check:strings
node scripts/check-unused-strings.mjs          # Report and prompt before removing unused keys
node scripts/check-unused-strings.mjs --check  # Exit non-zero if unused keys or locale shape issues exist
node scripts/check-unused-strings.mjs --fix    # Remove unused keys without prompting
node scripts/check-unused-strings.mjs --project-root /path/to/project-root
```

`npm run build` runs `npm run check:strings` before TypeScript validation and bundling. This also covers the main build scripts and release workflow.

To keep an intentionally dynamic key, add an allowlist comment:

```ts
// unused-strings keep settings.items.example
```

## check-unused-css.mjs

Builds the expected generated CSS from `src/styles/index.css` in memory, checks whether `styles.css` is stale, and scans `src` for unused plugin CSS classes and variables.

```bash
node scripts/check-unused-css.mjs          # Report unused CSS and stale generated CSS
node scripts/check-unused-css.mjs --check  # Exit non-zero if stale CSS or unused CSS exists
node scripts/check-unused-css.mjs --fix    # Regenerate stale styles.css, then check unused CSS
node scripts/check-unused-css.mjs --project-root /path/to/project-root
```

To keep intentional dynamic CSS usage, add an allowlist comment:

```css
/* unused-css keep nn-dynamic-class --nn-dynamic-variable */
```

## update-icon-packs.sh

Runs the icon pack updater from `icon-assets/scripts/update-icon-packs.ts`.

**Usage:**

```bash
./scripts/update-icon-packs.sh                     # Update all packs
./scripts/update-icon-packs.sh --check-only        # Check for updates without applying them
./scripts/update-icon-packs.sh --force             # Force updates
./scripts/update-icon-packs.sh --generate-only     # Regenerate bundled manifest files from local icon-assets
./scripts/update-icon-packs.sh phosphor --force    # Update a specific pack
```

**Features:**

- Uses `npx tsx` to run the TypeScript updater
- Supports updating all packs or selected pack IDs
- Supports check-only, forced update, and local manifest regeneration modes
