## Overview

The Notebook Navigator plugin has a multi-phase startup process that handles data synchronization and content
generation. The startup behavior differs between cold boots (empty/cleared cache) and warm boots (existing cache).

## Key Concepts

### Cold Boot

A **cold boot** occurs when:

- The plugin is installed for the first time
- The IndexedDB cache doesn't exist or is cleared
- Database version markers are missing in vault-scoped localStorage
- `DB_CONTENT_VERSION` has changed
- A schema downgrade or incompatible migration requires a rebuild

Characteristics:

- Full database initialization required
- All files need content generation
- Database is either created new or cleared completely

### Warm Boot

A **warm boot** occurs when:

- Obsidian is restarted with the plugin already enabled
- The plugin is enabled after being disabled
- Database exists with valid schema and content versions

Characteristics:

- Database already exists with cached data
- Only changed files and files missing derived content need processing
- Metadata cache is populated asynchronously; metadata-dependent providers wait for `metadataCache` entries

### Workspace Layout Restore

Obsidian can restore open tabs/leaves from the saved workspace layout.

For Notebook Navigator this matters because:

- On warm boots, the navigator view is often created by layout restore (not by `activateView()`).
- When `calendarPlacement` is `right-sidebar`, the calendar sidebar leaf is restored and managed independently of navigator leaves.
- On first launch, the plugin explicitly activates the view in `HomepageController.handleWorkspaceReady()` after
  `workspace.onLayoutReady()`.

### Version System

The plugin uses two version numbers to manage database state:

**DB_SCHEMA_VERSION**: Controls the IndexedDB structure

- Changes when database schema is modified (new indexes, stores, etc.)
- Used as the version passed to `indexedDB.open(...)`
- Upgrades run via `onupgradeneeded` (stores/indexes/migrations); some upgrades clear legacy payloads to force a rebuild
- Downgrades delete the database and rebuild

**DB_CONTENT_VERSION**: Controls the data format

- Changes when content structure or generation logic is modified
- Triggers data clearing but preserves database structure
- Examples: changing how previews are generated, tag extraction logic updates

Both versions are stored in localStorage to detect changes between sessions.

Version mismatches can result in a cold boot (empty `MemoryFileCache` + cleared stores) so providers regenerate content.
Schema downgrades and content version changes also set a pending rebuild notice that is consumed by StorageContext to
show progress.

## Startup Phases

### Phase 1: Plugin Registration (main.ts)

**Trigger**: Obsidian calls Plugin.onload() when enabling the plugin

1. Obsidian calls `Plugin.onload()`.
2. Initialize vault-scoped localStorage (`localStorage.init`) and startup diagnostics (`DebugLoggingService`) before any database work.
3. Register the plugin icon with Obsidian (`addIcon(...)`).
4. Initialize the language service and start a bounded local language-cache read. English and locale-specific date/time defaults are already bundled. Await only the cache read before loading settings; a missing pack starts a background download of the installed release's `languages.json`. Each validated locale is cached separately in one IndexedDB transaction.
   - Navigator and calendar view providers wait behind a language-loading boundary. Settings stay usable in English.
   - Commands and the first-launch welcome modal wait for language readiness so their labels are captured once.
   - Download failures, a request still running after 30 seconds, or **Continue in English** release the boundary with bundled English. The request keeps running in those last two cases, and a valid late response populates the cache for the next launch without changing the already-open English navigator.
   - A valid cache activates the selected language without a network request. Plugin unload discards pending download results.
5. Initialize IndexedDB early via `initializeDatabase(appId, ...)`.
   - Starts `db.init()` (schema check + `MemoryFileCache` hydration) asynchronously before views mount.
   - Operation is idempotent to support rapid enable/disable cycles.
   - Configures per-platform feature-image blob and preview-text cache limits.
   - Preview text strings stay in `filePreviews` and load on demand; the bounded preview-text warmup starts lazily
     after explicit preview loads.
6. Load settings from `data.json` and run migrations (`loadSettingsAtStartup`).
   - Classify each read: `loaded` (stored record read and applied through the settings pipeline), `missing` (no
     `data.json`), or `unavailable` (`data.json` exists but cannot be read or parsed). Non-`loaded` results apply
     nothing.
   - Retry non-`loaded` results four times over approximately 1.5 seconds so a sync provider can deliver the file
     during a bounded startup grace period. A `missing` result is confirmed as a first launch only when the device has
     no persisted localStorage version marker, no attempt returned `unavailable`, and the file stays missing through
     the window. Cold startup and runtime enablement use the same grace period because sync can deliver `data.json`
     after the plugin files.
   - When the file stays missing on a device that has a persisted localStorage version marker, startup ends `missing`
     and initialization pauses. Uninstalling deletes the plugin folder but not localStorage, so a reinstall is
     indistinguishable from a sync provider that has not delivered `data.json` yet. Obsidian calls `onUserEnable()`
     right after `onload` only when the user explicitly installed or enabled the plugin; that call rereads
     `data.json` (a file delivered in the meantime wins) and otherwise asks the user to confirm starting over with
     default settings, because an explicit enable can also be a manual toggle on a device where sync has not
     delivered the file. The dialog message reflects the plugin folder timestamp (recent install versus
     long-standing install) but both variants require the same confirmation, and `data.json` is reread once more
     after confirmation. Cancelling, or an aborted startup without a user enable, shows the settings-unavailable
     notice with the recovery command and startup stays aborted.
   - When startup ends `unavailable` (`data.json` exists but cannot be read), show a notice, register the
     `Restore default settings` recovery command, and abort initialization so no code path can overwrite `data.json`
     with defaults. The command confirms with a dialog, copies a readable `data.json` to a timestamped backup in the
     plugin folder, writes and verifies defaults, and only then clears plugin localStorage.
   - External settings reloads (`onExternalSettingsChange`) that arrive before initialization completes are queued
     and processed once startup completes. Reloads with a non-`loaded` result keep the current in-memory
     settings.
   - The settings pipeline (`applySettingsRecord`) sanitizes keyboard shortcuts, migrates legacy fields, applies
     default date/time formats, migrates folder note template settings, and normalizes tag, property, and navigation
     separator settings. Reset and settings import apply raw records through the same pipeline in memory and persist
     once, without rereading `data.json`.
7. Sync local mirrors and load per-device UX preferences.
   - Resolve sync-mode local mirrors from vault-scoped localStorage.
   - Load UX preferences from vault-scoped localStorage.
8. Handle first-launch setup when no saved data exists.
   - Clear plugin localStorage keys (preserving IndexedDB version markers).
   - Re-seed per-device localStorage mirrors for sync-mode settings and UX preferences.
   - Expand the root folder when `showRootFolder` is enabled.
   - Persist the current localStorage version (`LOCALSTORAGE_VERSION`).
9. Initialize recent data and UX tracking.
   - `RecentDataManager` loads persisted recent notes and icons.
   - `RecentNotesService` is created; `registerWorkspaceEvents` wires file-open tracking later in startup.
10. Construct core services and controllers:
   - `WorkspaceCoordinator` and `HomepageController` manage view activation and homepage flow.
   - `FolderNoteSidebarService` manages the right-sidebar companion leaf for folder notes.
   - `MetadataService`, `TagOperations`, `PropertyOperations`, `TagTreeService`, `PropertyTreeService`, and `CommandQueueService`.
   - `FileSystemOperations` wired with tag tree, property tree, and visibility preferences.
   - `OmnisearchService`, `NotebookNavigatorAPI`, and `ReleaseCheckService`.
   - `ExternalIconProviderController` initializes icon providers and syncs settings.
11. Register view, commands, settings tab, and workspace integrations.
   - Register `NOTEBOOK_NAVIGATOR_VIEW` (`NotebookNavigatorView`),
     `NOTEBOOK_NAVIGATOR_CALENDAR_VIEW` (`NotebookNavigatorCalendarView`), and
     `NOTEBOOK_NAVIGATOR_FOLDER_NOTE_SIDEBAR_VIEW` (`FolderNoteSidebarPlaceholderView`).
   - `registerNavigatorCommands` registers command palette metadata and lazy-loads command handlers on first use.
   - `registerWorkspaceEvents` adds editor/file-menu reveal actions, the ribbon icon, recent-note tracking,
     hidden-folder rename/delete sync, vault-icon asset notifications, and file/folder rename/delete handlers.
12. Wait for `workspace.onLayoutReady()`.
   - `HomepageController.handleWorkspaceReady()` activates the view on first launch and opens the configured homepage target when it resolves.
   - `FolderNoteSidebarService.handleWorkspaceReady()` synchronizes the folder-note companion leaf when right-sidebar
     folder notes are active.
   - On first launch, the Welcome modal is opened after the workspace is ready.
   - Consumes the pending PDF-processing diagnostic and opens an Info modal if the previous session ended mid-thumbnail.
   - Triggers Style Settings parsing, version notice checks, and optional release polling.
   - `applyCalendarPlacementView({ force: true, reveal: false })` syncs the calendar right-sidebar leaf with the
     effective calendar placement and detaches restored right-sidebar calendar leaves when placement is not
     `right-sidebar` or the calendar feature is disabled.

### Phase 2: View Creation

**Trigger**: Obsidian restores leaves from workspace layout, the plugin calls `activateView()` (commands/ribbon/menu),
calendar placement changes run after layout/settings updates, or folder-note sidebar sync creates/reuses a right-sidebar
companion leaf.

#### Navigator view (`NotebookNavigatorView.tsx`)

`activateView()` delegates to `WorkspaceCoordinator.activateNavigatorView()`:

- Reveals the first existing navigator leaf (when one exists).
- Otherwise creates a new left-sidebar leaf via `workspace.getLeftLeaf(false)` and `leaf.setViewState({ type: NOTEBOOK_NAVIGATOR_VIEW, active: true })`.

1. Obsidian calls `NotebookNavigatorView.onOpen()` when the view is created/restored.
2. React app mounts with the following context providers:
   - `SettingsProvider` (settings state and update actions)
   - `UXPreferencesProvider` (dual-pane and search preferences synced with the plugin)
   - `RecentDataProvider` (recent notes and icon lists)
   - `ServicesProvider` (Obsidian app, services, and platform flags)
   - `ShortcutsProvider` (pinned shortcut hydration and operations)
   - `StorageProvider` (IndexedDB access and content pipeline)
   - `ExpansionProvider` (expanded folders, tags, and properties)
   - `SelectionProvider` (selected items plus rename listeners from the plugin)
   - `UIStateProvider` (pane focus and layout mode)
   - `InternalDragSessionProvider` (internal drag session state)
3. `NotebookNavigatorContainer` renders a skeleton until `StorageContext.isStorageReady` is true.
4. `NotebookNavigatorView.onOpen()` adds platform classes and (on Android) applies font scaling compensation before React renders:
   - Always adds `notebook-navigator`.
   - Adds `notebook-navigator-mobile` and platform classes on mobile (`notebook-navigator-android`, `notebook-navigator-ios`).
5. Pane chrome uses headers on all platforms and toolbars on mobile:
   - `NavigationPaneHeader` and `ListPaneHeader` render in pane chrome above the scrollers.
   - Android mobile renders `NavigationToolbar` / `ListToolbar` at the top.
   - On iOS with floating toolbars enabled, the toolbars render inside the pane; otherwise they render in the bottom
     toolbar container.

#### Calendar right sidebar view (`NotebookNavigatorCalendarView.tsx`)

1. `applyCalendarPlacementView()` evaluates `settings.calendarPlacement` after layout readiness and on settings updates.
2. When the effective placement is `right-sidebar` and `calendarEnabled` is true, it calls
   `WorkspaceCoordinator.ensureCalendarViewInRightSidebar(...)`.
3. Obsidian calls `NotebookNavigatorCalendarView.onOpen()` when the calendar leaf is created/restored.
4. React app mounts with:
   - `SettingsProvider`
   - `ServicesProvider`
   - `CalendarRightSidebar`
5. `CalendarRightSidebar` renders `Calendar` with `weeksToShowOverride={6}` and forwards date-filter actions to the navigator view.
6. When placement changes away from `right-sidebar`, or the feature is disabled, `WorkspaceCoordinator.detachCalendarViewLeaves()`
   removes calendar leaves. Restored calendar leaves also detach themselves on open when the feature is disabled.

#### Folder note right sidebar placeholder (`FolderNoteSidebarPlaceholderView.ts`)

1. `FolderNoteSidebarService` starts during plugin startup and listens for settings updates.
2. After workspace layout readiness, the service synchronizes the right-sidebar companion leaf when folder notes are
   configured to open in the right sidebar.
3. `FolderNoteSidebarPlaceholderView` is registered so the service can keep a right-sidebar tab position when no
   folder note file is selected.
4. The placeholder view does not mount React providers or content processing; it clears its container on open.

### Phase 3: Database Version Check and Initialization

**Trigger**: Database initialization starts in Phase 1 and StorageContext awaits readiness

1. StorageContext retrieves the shared database instance.
   - Calls `getDBInstance()` and awaits `db.init()` (`useIndexedDBReady`).
   - Logs and keeps the flag false if initialization fails.
2. `IndexedDBStorage.init()` handles schema and content version checks.
   - Reads stored versions from vault-scoped localStorage.
   - Runs schema upgrades via `onupgradeneeded` and deletes the database on schema downgrades or open errors.
   - Opens the database with `skipCacheLoad=true` and clears stores when version markers are missing, `DB_CONTENT_VERSION`
     changes, or a schema downgrade is detected.
   - Sets a pending rebuild notice when a schema downgrade or `DB_CONTENT_VERSION` change is detected (not when keys are missing).
   - Persists the current versions back to localStorage.
3. Database opening and cache hydration:
   - Rebuilds start with an empty `MemoryFileCache`.
   - Warm boots load all records into the cache for synchronous access.
   - IndexedDB stores:
     - `keyvaluepairs`: file records (`FileData`) excluding preview text and blob payloads
     - `filePreviews`: preview text strings keyed by path (loaded on demand / warmup)
     - `featureImageBlobs`: thumbnail blobs keyed by path (cached in an in-memory LRU)
4. StorageContext creates a `ContentProviderRegistry` once and registers:
   - `MarkdownPipelineContentProvider` (`markdownPipeline`)
   - `FeatureImageContentProvider` (`fileThumbnails`)
   - `MetadataContentProvider` (`metadata`)
   - `TagContentProvider` (`tags`)
5. With `isIndexedDBReady` true, Phase 4 processing can begin.

#### Cold Boot Path (database empty or cleared):

1. Database is deleted or cleared during initialization.
2. `MemoryFileCache` starts empty because no cached data exists.
3. Providers remain idle until Phase 4 queues work.
4. Continue to Phase 4 with an empty database snapshot.

#### Warm Boot Path (database has existing data):

1. Database opens without recreation.
2. All records load into `MemoryFileCache`.
3. Providers have immediate access to cached content.
4. Continue to Phase 4 with populated data.

### Phase 4: Initial Data Load and Metadata Resolution

**Trigger**: Database initialization completes (from Phase 3)

This phase handles the initial synchronization between the vault and the database, then ensures metadata is ready for
tag extraction and markdown pipeline processing:

#### Initial load (`isInitialLoad=true`)

1. Gather indexable files with `getIndexableFiles()` from `useStorageFileQueries`
   (`getFilteredIndexableFiles(..., { showHiddenItems: true })`).
2. Calculate diffs through `calculateFileDiff()`.
   - Cold boot: all files appear as new (database cache is empty)
   - Warm boot: compare against cached data to find new/modified files
3. Apply the diff:
   - Remove deleted paths via `removeFilesFromCache(toRemove)`.
   - Upsert new/modified files via `recordFileChanges([...toAdd, ...toUpdate], existingData, pendingRenameData)`.
     - New files use `createDefaultFileData` (provider processed mtimes set to `0`; markdown records initialize `tags`,
       word/character counts, task counters, and `metadata` to `null`; `previewStatus` defaults to `unprocessed` for
       markdown and `none` for non-markdown).
     - Modified files patch the stored `mtime` without clearing existing provider outputs. Providers compare their
       processed mtime fields (`markdownPipelineMtime`, `tagsMtime`, `metadataMtime`, `fileThumbnailsMtime`) against
       `file.stat.mtime` to detect stale content.
4. Reconcile the frontmatter metadata mirror signature (`ensureFrontmatterMetadataCacheMatchesSettings`).
   - When frontmatter metadata is enabled and the stored settings signature in vault-scoped localStorage does not
     match the current frontmatter settings, clear stored `metadata` content via `batchClearAllFileContent('metadata')`
     and persist the new signature so the metadata provider regenerates mirrored metadata.
   - When frontmatter metadata is disabled, clear the stored signature.
5. Rebuild tag and property trees via `rebuildTagTree()` and `rebuildPropertyTree()` (both share one visible-file scan).
6. Mark storage as ready (`setIsStorageReady(true)` and the internal Notebook Navigator API readiness bridge).
7. Queue content generation:
   - Determine metadata-dependent provider types with `getMetadataDependentTypes(settings)`:
     - Includes `markdownPipeline` for word/character counts, task counters, preview/property/feature image pipelines.
     - Includes `tags` when `showTags` is enabled.
     - Includes `metadata` when frontmatter metadata is enabled or hidden-file frontmatter rules are active.
   - `queueMetadataContentWhenReady(markdownFiles, metadataDependentTypes, settings)` filters to files needing work, waits for
     Obsidian's metadata cache (`resolved` and `changed`), then queues providers in `ContentProviderRegistry`.
   - When `showFeatureImage` is enabled, queue the `fileThumbnails` provider for supported non-markdown feature-image files (filtered by `filterFilesRequiringFileThumbnails`).

#### Ongoing sync (`isInitialLoad=false`)

- Create, delete, and rename events debounce a cache rebuild.
- Modify events buffer files and flush after `TIMEOUTS.FILE_OPERATION_DELAY`; the flush records stat changes via
  `recordFileChanges` and queues content refresh for non-markdown files only. Markdown content generation is queued
  by the metadata-change flush after Obsidian has indexed the save.
- Diff processing is deferred with a zero-delay `setTimeout` and uses the same `calculateFileDiff` + `recordFileChanges` /
  `removeFilesFromCache` flow.
- Renames seed `MemoryFileCache` with the old record, move preview/feature-image artifacts, then schedule a diff to reconcile mtimes.
- Metadata cache `changed` events can force regeneration (`markFilesForRegeneration`) so providers re-run even when file mtimes do not change (processed mtimes reset to `0` without clearing existing outputs).
- When files are removed and tags are enabled, tag tree rebuild is scheduled.
- When files are removed and properties are enabled, property tree rebuild is scheduled (flushed after removals).

#### Data Flow Diagram

The metadata cache gating is managed by `queueMetadataContentWhenReady()` (using `metadataCache.getFileCache(file)` plus
`metadataCache` `resolved`/`changed` events) and queues metadata-dependent providers once cache entries exist:

```

#### Metadata Cleanup

**Purpose**: Remove orphaned metadata for folders, tags, and files deleted or renamed outside of Obsidian. Metadata
cleanup is performed manually from settings.

**When It's Needed**:

- Files/folders deleted directly from file system
- Files/folders renamed outside of Obsidian
- Vault synchronized with missing or renamed files
- Files renamed or deleted by external tools or scripts
- After major vault reorganization outside Obsidian
- Sync conflicts that resulted in orphaned metadata

**How to Run**: Open Settings → Notebook Navigator → Advanced → Clean up metadata

**What Gets Cleaned**:

- Folder colors, icons, sort settings, and background colors for deleted/renamed folders
- Tag colors, icons, sort settings, and background colors for removed tags
- Property colors, icons, and sort overrides for property nodes no longer present
- Pinned notes that no longer exist
- Custom appearances for non-existent items
- Navigation separators for missing targets

**Technical Details**: The cleanup process uses validators to compare stored metadata against the current vault state.
See `MetadataService.cleanupAllMetadata()` and `MetadataService.getCleanupSummary()` for implementation.

### Phase 5: Background Processing

**Trigger**: Files queued by ContentProviderRegistry (from Phase 4)

Content is generated asynchronously in the background by the ContentProviderRegistry and individual providers:

1. **File Detection**: Each provider checks if files need processing
   - TagContentProvider (markdown): `tags === null` or `tagsMtime !== file.stat.mtime` (only when `showTags` is enabled)
     - When tags are forced to regenerate (`tagsMtime` reset to `0`), the provider retries before replacing an existing non-empty tag list with an empty result.
   - MarkdownPipelineContentProvider (markdown): runs when any of the following are true:
     - `markdownPipelineMtime !== file.stat.mtime`
     - `wordCount === null`
     - `characterCountWithSpaces === null` or `characterCountWithoutSpaces === null`
     - `taskTotal === null` or `taskUnfinished === null`
     - `showFilePreview` is enabled and `previewStatus === 'unprocessed'`
     - `showFeatureImage` is enabled and (`featureImageKey === null` or `featureImageStatus === 'unprocessed'`)
     - Property pills are configured and `properties === null`
   - FeatureImageContentProvider (non-markdown feature-image files): `fileThumbnailsMtime !== file.stat.mtime`, `featureImageStatus === 'unprocessed'`,
     `featureImageKey === null`, or `featureImageKey` mismatches the expected provider key
   - MetadataContentProvider (markdown): `metadata === null`, `metadataMtime !== file.stat.mtime`, or hidden-state tracking requires an update

2. **Queue Management**: Files are queued based on enabled settings
   - ContentProviderRegistry manages the queue
   - Processes files in batches and yields between batches
   - Uses deferred scheduling for background processing
   - `queueMetadataContentWhenReady()` delays metadata-dependent providers (markdown pipeline, tags, metadata) until Obsidian's metadata cache has entries

3. **Processing**: Each provider processes files independently
   - TagContentProvider: Extracts tags from Obsidian's metadata cache (`getAllTags(metadata)`)
   - MarkdownPipelineContentProvider: Uses metadata cache for frontmatter/offsets, reads markdown content when needed, runs preview/word count/character count/task/property/feature image processors
   - FeatureImageContentProvider: Generates or marks feature images for supported non-markdown files (PDF and SVG thumbnails and non-markdown drawing files)
   - MetadataContentProvider: Extracts configured frontmatter fields and hidden state from Obsidian's metadata cache

4. **Database Updates**: Results stored in IndexedDB
   - Providers apply updates via `IndexedDBStorage` (main records + preview store + feature image blob store)
   - Database fires content change events

5. **Memory Sync**: MemoryFileCache automatically synced with IndexedDB changes

6. **UI Updates**: StorageContext listens for database changes
   - Tag changes trigger tag tree rebuild (buildTagTreeFromDatabase)
   - Property-related changes trigger property tree rebuild (`buildPropertyTreeFromDatabase`)
   - Components re-render with new content via React context

#### Cache rebuild progress notice

The cache rebuild progress notice tracks background provider work during a full cache rebuild and other bulk regeneration triggers.

- Manual rebuilds (and settings-driven bulk regenerations) persist a vault-scoped localStorage marker (`STORAGE_KEYS.cacheRebuildNoticeKey`)
  with the initial work total used for the progress bar.
- Schema downgrades, `DB_CONTENT_VERSION` changes, and IndexedDB open errors set an in-memory `pendingRebuildNotice` flag in
  `IndexedDBStorage` that is consumed on initial load to start the notice.
- On the next startup, StorageContext restores the notice from the localStorage marker after storage is marked ready and uses current
  settings to determine which content types to track.
- The marker is cleared when the notice detects that all tracked content types have no pending work.

## Critical Timing Mechanisms

### Deferred Scheduling

StorageContext and content providers defer heavy work so it does not run directly inside Obsidian event handlers:

- Vault diff processing is deferred with `setTimeout(..., 0)` so bursts of vault events can coalesce.
- Metadata cache gating batches queue flushes with `setTimeout(..., 0)`.
- Content providers yield between batches with `setTimeout(..., 0)` (`yieldToEventLoop`).

### Debouncing

The plugin uses debouncers in a few specific places where Obsidian emits bursty events:

- Vault syncing uses Obsidian `debounce(..., TIMEOUTS.FILE_OPERATION_DELAY)` to collapse create/delete bursts into one diff.
- Tag tree rebuilds use Obsidian `debounce(..., TIMEOUTS.DEBOUNCE_TAG_TREE)` because tag updates can arrive in batches.
- Property tree rebuilds use the same `TIMEOUTS.DEBOUNCE_TAG_TREE` debouncer to batch rapid updates.
- Modify and metadata-change flush buffers use `window.setTimeout(..., TIMEOUTS.FILE_OPERATION_DELAY)` to batch per-file flushes.
- Settings changes that affect derived content are collapsed with `TIMEOUTS.DEBOUNCE_CONTENT` (a `setTimeout`) into a single
  regeneration pass (`useStorageSettingsSync`).

## Shutdown Process

### Phase 1: Plugin Unload (main.ts)

**Trigger**: Obsidian calls Plugin.onunload() when disabling the plugin

1. `Plugin.onunload()` calls `initiateShutdown()`.
2. `initiateShutdown()` sets the `isUnloading` flag and flushes shutdown-critical work:
   - Flush pending recent-data persists.
   - Clear queued command operations.
   - Stop content processing in mounted navigator leaves and unmount mounted calendar React roots.
   - Call `shutdownDatabase()` to close IndexedDB and clear in-memory caches.
3. `preferencesController.dispose()` then disposes `RecentDataManager` and clears recent-data / UX listeners, and
   `FolderNoteSidebarService.dispose()` unregisters its settings listener and clears suppression timers.
4. Clear listener maps to avoid callbacks during teardown:
   - Settings update listeners
   - File rename listeners
5. Dispose long-lived services/controllers and clear remaining references:
   - `ExternalIconProviderController.dispose()` releases icon provider hooks.
   - `MetadataService.dispose()` tears down metadata watchers.
   - Remaining service refs are nulled after cleanup.
6. Remove the ribbon icon element.

### Phase 2: View Cleanup

**Trigger**: `ItemView.onClose()` when a navigator, calendar, or folder-note placeholder leaf is destroyed

1. `NotebookNavigatorView.onClose()` removes CSS classes from the container:
   - notebook-navigator
   - notebook-navigator-mobile (if applicable)
   - notebook-navigator-android / notebook-navigator-ios (if applicable)
   - notebook-navigator-ios-floating-toolbars (if applicable)
2. `NotebookNavigatorView.onClose()` unmounts the React root:
   - Call root.unmount()
   - Set root to null
   - Clear the container element
3. `NotebookNavigatorCalendarView.onClose()` unregisters the settings listener, unmounts the React root, and tears down the view container classes.
4. Storage subtree cleanup happens in two layers:
   - `NotebookNavigatorView.stopContentProcessing()` reaches `StorageContext.stopAllProcessing()`, which marks storage
     stopped, cancels debouncers/timeouts, detaches vault and metadata listeners, and clears pending metadata waits.
   - `useInitializeContentProviderRegistry()` stops provider queues and clears deferred sync timers when the storage
     subtree unmounts.
5. `FolderNoteSidebarPlaceholderView` has no custom close cleanup because it does not mount React providers or start
   background processing.

### Key Principles

1. **Clear Ownership**: Plugin owns database lifecycle, not React components
2. **Processing Before Shutdown**: Always stop content providers before closing database
3. **Idempotent Operations**: Both initializeDatabase and shutdownDatabase are safe to call multiple times
4. **Prevent Late Operations**: isUnloading flag prevents new operations during shutdown
5. **Clean Separation**: Database lifecycle is separate from view lifecycle
